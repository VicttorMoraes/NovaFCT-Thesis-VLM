Urban freight operators face increasing pressure to decarbonize while managing long-lived assets under volatile and uncertain cost drivers such as fuel and electricity prices, technology cost evolution, and residual values. This dissertation proposes a decision-support framework for urban fleet replacement planning that explicitly balances economic performance and cost risk under uncertainty. Building on a mean–variance portfolio perspective, vehicle technologies are treated as "assets" whose lifecycle costs exhibit distinct expected values and variances.

The planning problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer optimization model that minimizes (i) the \emph{Expected Total Cost} over the planning period and (ii) the \emph{Variance of Total Cost} across a discrete set of uncertainty scenarios. Fleet dynamics are represented through vehicle aging, acquisition, and retirement constraints, enabling heterogeneous technologies (diesel, electric, hybrid) and potentially multiple vehicle classes. To characterize the efficient set of cost-risk trade-offs, the $\varepsilon$-constraint method is adopted: the expected cost is minimized while imposing an upper bound $\varepsilon$ on the cost variance, and $\varepsilon$ is varied systematically to generate Pareto-optimal replacement plans.

A case study is planned for an urban operator in Lisbon (public or private). If proprietary operational data cannot be obtained, the model will be parameterized using data from the literature and publicly available sources. The resulting efficient frontier is expected to support managerial and policy analysis by revealing how risk tolerance, uncertainty in energy prices, and technology trajectories influence optimal fleet composition and replacement timing.
